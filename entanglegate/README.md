# EntangleGate: LumenCore Interface v0.1

**Neuroarchitectural Gateway for Mutual Cognition**

Welcome to the official microsite for the EntangleGate project, hosted at [mutual-mind.org/entanglegate](https://mutual-mind.org/entanglegate/).

EntangleGate proposes a novel interface for intercepting and modulating inter-hemispheric brain activity through a programmable, biocompatible membrane embedded in the corpus callosum. The system enables both intra- and inter-brain semantic gating, offering a pathway to mutual cognition.
